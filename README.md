# bank-queue-challenge
A bank, ABC Bank, has many branches and customers. Each branch has a limited number of teller counters. ABC Bank would like to improve their customer experience at each branch. Managing long queues of customers at the bank during business hours is one of the most challenging tasks. ABC Bank also provides a better customer experience to their premium customers by providing priority over non premium customers (less waiting time at branches). In order to achieve this, ABC Bank has decided to introduce new machines to manage queues at each of their branches.
